@title[This presentation]

#### This slidedeck is interactive and has links!

![](assets/qrcode-to-slides.png?raw=true)


Note:

- What I meant with the title is that it's an interactive session, and only you can shape it the way you want.
  I hope you will leave this presentation with at least one take away: Contribute upstream.
- This is the usual "Who are we" slide
- We also explain the presentation is a story, starting for a contributor from 0 to hero.
- If you are wondering where heroes are needed, this is further in the presentation
- Anyone can be a hero

#### Why would I want to contribute upstream?
@snapend

Note:

- For Reponsibility: What I mean by that is that if we selling an (OpenStack) product, we have a responsability to invest in its raw material, the upstream projects.
- For Self-improvement: If you are active in an upstream project, you will learn its code, its people, helping you grow your skills, know more about the project code (That will help you in product design, in solving customer problems, and many others).
- For Belongingness: Everything is awesome when you're part of a team. Land emergency patches with the trust you earned, and help others in the same case to strengthen the bond. We are all in that **** together).

- ask questions on changes you don't understand, this helps improve your understanding of the code and builds rapport with the team
- leave a +1 vote if you understand the code and think it's a good change
- leave a -1 vote if you disagree with the change or think the code needs significant work before it should be merged
- do not leave a +1 if you don't understand the change
- do not leave a -1 for nitpicks like typos

Note:

- We are now in community goals pre-work time. If no pre-work is done for those ideas of community goals, they won't be accepted as goals, and nothing will happen with them. Current goals mentionned for community goals: Deletion of project resources (chained purges), moving legacy CLIs to python-openstackclient, improve oslo healthcheck mw for real API healthchecks. Current goals are python3 and pre-upgrade checks.
- For the help wanted currently listed: We currently have Docs, Infra, Glance, Designate, Goal champions.
  4 are upstream projects and we are using them all for our product.
